<h1><b>Project Euler Solutions </b></h1>

This repository contains my solutions to <a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems as I solve them. 

Each problem has its own folder. The folder for each problem contains a README.md file with the problem. Complicated solutions are documented in comments in the code.
